# CoreDataSelectionTest

This is a work-in-progress test project attempting to build the "skeleton" of a macOS sourcelist based app using SwiftUI, MVVM design patterns and Core Data. 

Please feel free to use this code in any way you want. I make no promises or guarantees that I've done things correctly.

I've followed the basic architecture from a helpful video by Karin Prater: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63oyC5bUujc, but any mistakes are entirely my fault.
